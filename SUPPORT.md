You can find the docs for the Elm package [here](https://package.elm-lang.org/packages/jfmengels/elm-review/latest/), and the ones for the CLI [here](https://github.com/jfmengels/node-elm-review/).

The #elm-review channel on the [Elm Slack](http://elmlang.herokuapp.com/) is the fastest way to get help using or creating rules with the tool.

I hope this helped!
